## Getting Started

To start contributing to pycountry, follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally using ``git clone <your-fork-url>``.
3. Navigate to the cloned directory: ``cd pycountry``.
4. Install the project and its dependencies: ``pip install -e .`` (This installs the package in editable mode).
5. Create a new feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`).
6. Make your changes and commit them (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`).
7. Push the branch to GitHub (`git push origin my-new-feature`).
8. Submit a pull request.

Please ensure your code adheres to the project's coding standards and includes appropriate tests.

## Code of Conduct

Please note that pycountry has a [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/pycountry/pycountry/blob/main/CODEOFCONDUCT.md) that we expect all contributors and community members to adhere to. By participating in this project, you agree to abide by its terms.

## Prerequisites

Before contributing, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python (3.8 or later)
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) for dependency management
- [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) (commonly pre-installed on Unix-like systems)

## Making Changes

When making changes to the codebase, keep the following in mind:

- Create a new branch for each feature or bug fix.
- Write clear and concise commit messages.
- Keep your changes focused and avoid unrelated code modifications.
- Update documentation as needed.

## Testing

To maintain the quality of ``pycountry``, we encourage contributors to run tests and perform code quality checks before submitting any changes. ``pycountry`` uses Poetry for dependency management and tools like ``mypy``, ``pre-commit``, and ``pytest`` for testing and linting.

To run the test suite:

1. Install Poetry if you haven't already. Visit the Poetry website for [installation instructions](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).
2. Install the project dependencies by running ``poetry install`` in the project's root directory. This command also installs necessary tools like `mypy` and `pre-commit` as defined in `pyproject.toml`.
3. Activate the Poetry shell with ``poetry shell``. This will spawn a new shell subprocess, which is configured to use your projectâ€™s virtual environment.
4. Run the unit tests, linting checks, and type checks using ``make check``. Ensure you have `make` installed on your system (commonly pre-installed on Unix-like systems).
5. Ensure all tests pass successfully.

Note: The project's dependencies and the environment needed to run tests are managed by Poetry, using the `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock` files.

If you add new features or fix bugs, please include corresponding tests to ``src/pycountry/tests/test_general.py``. Follow the project's coding standards and update [documentation](#documentation) as needed.

## Coding Guidelines

Follow the coding style and guidelines used in the project. We use [black](https://github.com/psf/black) and [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/) for code formatting. Make sure your code aligns with these tools' recommendations.

## Pull Requests

When submitting a pull request:

- Follow the standard Pull Request Template.
- Provide a clear and descriptive title.
- Explain the purpose and context of the changes in the description.
- Reference any related issues or PRs.
- Be responsive to feedback and make necessary revisions.

## Review Process

Expect code reviews from maintainers and contributors. Be open to feedback and be prepared to make revisions to your code.

## Documentation

If your contribution requires changes to documentation, please update the documentation accordingly. This includes code comments, [HISTORY](https://github.com/pycountry/pycountry/blob/main/HISTORY.txt) and [README](https://github.com/pycountry/pycountry/blob/main/README.rst) files.
