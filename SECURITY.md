# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security is a top priority for our project. We are committed to providing updates and addressing security vulnerabilities in a timely manner. Below is a list of versions of our project currently receiving security updates.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 23.x    | :white_check_mark: |
| 22.x    | :white_check_mark: |
| <20.x   | :x:                |

## Staying Up to Date

We strongly encourage our users to always use the latest version of our project. While we strive to backport security patches to previous versions, the most comprehensive security and feature enhancements are available in the latest version. Keeping up to date ensures that you benefit from the latest improvements and protection against vulnerabilities.

### Why Update?

- **Security**: The latest versions contain patches for recently discovered vulnerabilities that may impact your environment.
- **Stability**: Each new release includes bug fixes and enhancements that improve the overall stability of the software.
- **Features**: New versions often come with new features and improvements that enhance usability and performance.

### How to Update

We make the process of updating straightforward. To update to the latest version of `pycountry`, simply run the following command:

```bash
pip install pycountry --upgrade
```

## End-of-Life Policy

It's important to note that when a version reaches its end-of-life (EOL), it will no longer receive security updates. We provide advance notice of EOL dates for older versions through our release notes and communication channels to give users ample time to plan their upgrade.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously and encourage responsible disclosure of any vulnerabilities you may discover in our project. To report a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Use GitHub's Security Features:** We prefer that you report security vulnerabilities through GitHub's Security tab, which provides a structured and secure way to handle such reports. To do this, navigate to our repository on GitHub.

2. **Create a New Security Advisory:** In our GitHub repository, go to the "Security" tab. Under "Advisories," you can create a new security advisory. Please provide as much detail as possible, including:

   - A clear and concise description of the vulnerability.
   - Steps to reproduce the vulnerability, if applicable.
   - Information about the affected versions.
   - Any mitigations or workarounds, if known.

3. **Security Review:** Once you've submitted the security advisory, our security team will review it promptly. We aim to acknowledge your report within one (1) week. 

4. **Assessment and Communication:** We will assess the reported vulnerability and keep you updated on our progress. You can expect regular communication about the status of your report. If additional information is required, we will request it from you.

5. **Resolution and Disclosure:** If the vulnerability is accepted, we will work on resolving it and will release a fix as soon as possible. Once the vulnerability is resolved, we will communicate the details, including the fix and any necessary updates, through the security advisory on GitHub.

6. **Responsible Disclosure:** We appreciate your commitment to responsible disclosure. We kindly request that you do not publicly disclose the vulnerability or any details about it until we have had the opportunity to address it and provide a fix. After the issue is resolved and made public, we will credit you for your responsible disclosure, if desired.

We greatly value your contributions to the security of our project and thank you for helping us maintain a safe and secure environment for all users.

**Note:** This process is in line with responsible security disclosure practices. We encourage you to follow this process for the safety and security of all users.
