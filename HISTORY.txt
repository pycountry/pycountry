  Romuald Brunet.

- Update data to iso-codes 3.26.


0.13 (2010-04-23)
-----------------

- Applied patch from Pedro Araujo which removes the somewhat superfluous
  dependency on lxml to the builtin minidom. This seems to consistently turn
  all strings into unicode even if they only contain ASCII characters.


0.12.1 (2010-04-21)
-------------------

- Remedy brown-bag release 0.12 which was missing all data files due to a bad
  interaction between the build system for the data and zest.releaeser's
  full-release script.


0.12 (2010-04-20)
-----------------

- Follow Debian repository to git.

- Upgrade data to revision 770fa9cd603f90f9fb982b32fe6f45d253f1d33e as
  requested by #5488 and others.

- Reflect subdivision changes with how they reference their parents in the XML
  (they used to use space as a separator but now use a hyphen).

- Refactor index building structures a bit.

- Remove superfluous 'code' index from subdivision database. (Together with
  the data upgrade this also gets rid of all the annoying warnings as
  described in #6667).

- Some light PEP 8 improvements.

0.11 (2009-03-03)
-----------------

- Updated Debian repository to r1752.


0.10 (2008-06-26)
